Powered by [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django), Cookiecutter Django Norntri is a slimmed down version for building
production-ready Django projects quickly.


## Features

- For Django 5.2
- Works with Python 3.13
- Renders Django projects with 100% starting test coverage
- Twitter [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) v5

- Secure by default. We believe in SSL.
- Optimized development and production settings
- Registration via [django-allauth](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth)
- Comes with custom user model ready to go
- Optional basic ASGI setup for Websockets
- Optional custom static build using Gulp or Webpack
- Send emails via [Anymail](https://github.com/anymail/django-anymail) (using [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) by default or Amazon SES if AWS is selected cloud provider, but switchable)
- Media storage using Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage or nginx
- Docker support using [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) for development and production (using [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) with [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) support)
- [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) for deploying to Heroku
- Instructions for deploying to [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
- Run tests with unittest or pytest

- Default integration with [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) for identifying simple issues before submission to code review

## Optional Integrations

_These features can be enabled during initial project setup._

- Serve static files from Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage or [Whitenoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/)
- Configuration for [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev) and [Flower](https://github.com/mher/flower) (the latter in Docker setup only)
- Integration with [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/) for local email testing
- Integration with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for error logging

## Constraints

- Only maintained 3rd party libraries are used.
- Uses PostgreSQL everywhere: 14 - 18 ([MySQL fork](https://github.com/mabdullahadeel/cookiecutter-django-mysql) also available).
- Environment variables for configuration (This won't work with Apache/mod_wsgi).


## Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to do all the work.

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

    uv tool install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"

Now run it against this repo:

    uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.

**Warning**: After this point, change 'Daniel Greenfeld', 'pydanny', etc to your own information.

Answer the prompts with your own desired [options](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-getting-started/project-generation-options.html). For example:

Enter the project and take a look around:

    cd reddit/
    ls

Create a git repo and push it there:

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "first awesome commit"
    git remote add origin git@github.com:pydanny/redditclone.git
    git push -u origin main

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?

## Not Exactly What You Want?

This is what I want. _It might not be what you want._ Don't worry, you have options:

### Fork This

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this to create your own version.
Once you have your fork working, let me know and I'll add it to a '_Similar Cookiecutter Templates_' list here.
It's up to you whether to rename your fork.

If you do rename your fork, I encourage you to submit it to the following places:

- [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) so it gets listed in the README as a template.
- The cookiecutter [grid](https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/cookiecutters/) on Django Packages.

### Submit a Pull Request

We accept pull requests if they're small, atomic, and make our own project development
experience better.
